## Abstract


The main purpose of this diploma thesis is to study the Few-Shot Learning concept and one of the most basic Artificial Neural Networks type, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The above terms come under the purview of Machine Learning, which is an integral part of the Artificial Intelligence field.

Few-Shot Learning constitutes one of the biggest challenges and one of the most upcoming and evolutional research fields in this domain. This is due to the structural differences between the traditional machine learning methods and the few-shot learning methods. In traditional learning methods, a huge amount of data is used for the model’s training, while in few-shot learning methods the model can learn with little or no data at all, and in that way simulate human learning.

Convolutional Neural Networks is one of the most used types of artificial neural networks, applied to a variety of tasks (such as face recognition, object detection and recognition, natural language processing, and more), with predominant use in Computer Vision applications. Their functionality is based on the mathematical operation of convolution, and they are inspired by the visual brain cells of living creatures.

The principal objective of this diploma thesis is the performance monitoring and comparison of diverse convolutional classifiers, as well as the creation and development of new models for the Few-Shot Image Classification task.

More specifically, the study is based on the Generation-0 algorithm, introduced by Jathushan Rajasegaran et al in the “Self-supervised Knowledge Distillation for Few-shot Learning” [1] research paper. The official code implementation of their work ([https://github.com/brjathu/SKD](https://github.com/brjathu/SKD)) [1] constitutes the experimental basis for this diploma thesis. Generation-0 algorithm is a method where the traditional learning is combined with the addition and solution by the model during its training of an auxiliary task where the algorithm uses Self-Supervised Learning to create the auxiliary task data. With their approach, Jathushan Rajasegaran et al. [1] achieved the creation of more powerful models for the Few-shot Image Classification task.

During this thesis implementation, a total of three comparative cases are herein made focusing on:
- the effect of the convolutional networks Resnets [31] depth to the Few-Shot Image Classification performance with the utilization of Generation-0 algorithm [1],
- the effect of the convolutional networks Resnets [31] width to the same task, as well as the exploration of the assumption that the addition of a SE block [32] to the network would boost the models’ performance, and lastly,
- the assumption that a different auxiliary Self-supervised task, specifically with the usage of a Variational Autoencoder [63], would lead to improvements to the Few-Shot Image Classification task.
